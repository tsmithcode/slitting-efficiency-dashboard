            This productivity tracking system was independently developed by Thomas Smith, inspired by real-world challenges observed during his work at Habasit America’s headquarters in Suwanee, GA — a major U.S. site for the manufacturing of fabric and plastic modular conveyor belts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The solution was designed to address common operational gaps by enabling real-time tracking of machine performance, operator productivity, and engineering output across departments. It facilitates collaboration between drafters, engineers, process specialists, and leadership to support data-driven continuous improvement across industries.

            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Manufacturing & Continuous Improvement Engineer</p>
            Criseida originated the spreadsheet used for slitting tracking — covering 9 machines, 27 operators, 2 shifts, 2 supervisors, and 2 team leads. Her initiative led to the first business case.
            <br />
            She now uses the app to track daily production and over 25 Pareto categories including: <em>PTO</em>, <em>Machine down</em>, <em>Waiting for material</em>, <em>Training</em>, <em>Early leaving</em>, and more.

            Steve created all U.S. special build plastic modular belt drawings before Thomas joined, and helped standardize CAD practices. He now uses the app to track <strong>fabric belt flex cutting</strong> performance and mentor new contributors to the engineering process.

                <strong>Habasit Role:</strong> CAD Drafter
            </p>

            <p>
                Thomas joined Habasit America and quickly recognized a critical gap in how operator productivity and finished goods were tracked. Using Blazor and C#, he built this platform to replace spreadsheets with a long-term, no-code, data-driven solution.
            </p>

            <p>
                He designed the app to scale to <strong>millions of engineers and machines globally</strong> over 20+ years, making technical decisions with zero-maintenance in mind. His vision is to license the system to enterprise manufacturers like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Daikin Applied.
            </p>

            Thomas actively uses the app to track special build plastic modular belt drawings in the U.S.
