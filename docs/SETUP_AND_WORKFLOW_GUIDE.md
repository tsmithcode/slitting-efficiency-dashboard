Perfectly understood — I’ll now generate the **full setup and user workflow guide**, organized by:

---

## 📦 **Project Setup & Installation Guide**  
_(Structured by phase, using Blazor Server for faster development + clean architecture)_

---

### 🔰 **PHASE 0 – ENVIRONMENT SETUP**

#### ✅ Install Dependencies

```bash
dotnet new install Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Templates
dotnet new blazorserver -n SlittingDashboard
cd SlittingDashboard
```

#### ✅ Install Required NuGet Packages

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web
dotnet add package CsvHelper
dotnet add package System.Text.Json
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### ✅ Recommended Folder Structure

```
SlittingDashboard/
├── Data/
│   ├── Models/
│   │   ├── ShiftSummary.cs
│   │   ├── OperatorEntry.cs
│   │   └── DailyShiftSnapshot.cs
│   ├── Services/
│   │   ├── IShiftTrackingService.cs
│   │   ├── IPerformanceAggregator.cs
│   │   └── MockSnapshotService.cs
├── Pages/
│   ├── Input.razor
│   └── Dashboard.razor
├── Shared/
│   └── Layout.razor
└── wwwroot/
    └── js/
        └── export.js (optional JS interop for CSV/PDF)
```

---

## 🚧 **PHASE 1 – MODEL & SERVICE SETUP**

#### 🧱 Models: `ShiftSummary`, `OperatorEntry`, `DailyShiftSnapshot`

> File: `/Data/Models/*.cs`

Includes:
- `Shift`, `Date`, `DailyGoal`, `HourlyOrders`
- `Efficiency` calculation property
- `Dictionary<string, int> Issues` for flexible tracking

#### 🧠 Services: `IShiftTrackingService`, `IPerformanceAggregator`

> File: `/Data/Services/*.cs`

- Inject into `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IPerformanceAggregator, PerformanceAggregator>();
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IShiftTrackingService, ShiftTrackingService>();
```

---

## 🧾 **PHASE 2 – SHIFT INPUT UI**

> File: `Pages/Input.razor`

- Uses `<EditForm>` for model binding
- Dynamic operator rows
- Auto-calculates total orders/goals
- Submits to `IPerformanceAggregator`

---

## 📊 **PHASE 2.5 – DASHBOARD CHARTS**

> File: `Pages/Dashboard.razor`  
> React-like code lives in `DashboardCharts.razor.cs` (code-behind or co-located)

- Orders vs Goal (LineChart)
- Issue Totals (BarChart)
- Pareto of Issues (ComposedChart)
- CSV export and Print support

> Tailwind CSS should be used for layout & mobile responsiveness.

---

## 🧰 **PHASE 3 – ENHANCEMENTS**

| Feature               | Status       |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| Filter by Shift       | ✅ Complete |
| Filter by Operator    | ✅ Complete |
| Print to PDF          | ✅ Complete |
| Export to CSV         | ✅ Complete |
| Color-coded Alerts    | ✅ Complete |
| Rolling Averages      | 🔄 Optional |
| Data Persistence/API  | 🔄 Future |

---

## 🧪 **TESTING & DEPLOYMENT**

- Use `dotnet watch run` for dev loop
- Deploy via IIS, Azure App Service, or internal server
- Copy `wwwroot` assets if using embedded Recharts or JS helpers
- Optional: Bundle printable views with `@media print` styling

---

## 👥 **USER WORKFLOW GUIDE (By Role)**

---

### 👷 **Team Leads**

**Daily Tasks:**
- Open **Input Page** at shift start
- Enter operator names, slitter numbers, and goals
- Update hourly order counts
- Select issue type if any problems occur
- Submit shift data at end of shift

**Use Dashboard:**
- View current day performance
- Identify missed goals or spikes in issues
- Use Print/PDF for handoff to next shift

---

### 🧑‍🏭 **Supervisors**

**Weekly Tasks:**
- Open **Dashboard**
- Filter by week, shift, or operator
- Review:
  - Orders vs Goal trends
  - Top issue categories
  - Efficiency % changes
- Export CSV to include in weekly report

---

### 🧑‍💼 **Managers / Leadership**

**Monthly Tasks:**
- Access Dashboard
- Filter by month or YTD
- View:
  - Pareto analysis
  - Daily and weekly trends
  - High-issue or low-efficiency periods
- Print full PDF view for discussion
- Identify opportunities for training or process improvements

---

## 🧠 Final Notes

- All business goals (orders, issues, efficiency) are met in real-time
- Designed for low-friction use in meetings and reviews
- Ready for future integrations with databases, APIs, and BI tools

I can also generate a 1-page quick-start cheat sheet for users.
